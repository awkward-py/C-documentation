Explanation:

- `#include <stdio.h>`: This line includes the standard input/output library, allowing us to use functions like `printf` to display messages.

- `int main()`: Every C program starts execution from the `main` function. The `int` before `main` indicates that the function returns an integer.

- `printf("Hello, AwkwardPy! You just created your first C program.\n");`: This line prints the message inside the parentheses to the console. `\n` is used to add a newline character for a cleaner output.

- `return 0;`: This statement indicates that the program executed successfully. A return value of 0 conventionally signifies success.
